# Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebooks are provided by the PDP Team. If you have any questions
ask directly at their [mailbox](mailto:pdp@srgssr.ch).

## Samples

We will provide Samples from the PDP team in the directory samples. We recommend not to
define your own files in this directory as it may be removed or overwritten.

## Shared Folder

If you save something in the "shared/" folder, everybody can see it. Be aware that we use
no restrictions on this folder, so you can delete also files from other users.

Just be nice inside the folder.
